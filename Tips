**** NO AUTOMATIC PROMOTION (for science) ***** 

***** RESEARCH - UNLOCK ABILITY TO MAKE TANK/REVOLVER ETC...****

***** FIELDLEADER (determins env)****** 

**** WEALFARE STATE VS DICTATORSHIPS ****

*** ALLIANCE WAR ALLIES STEP IN (AUTOALLY) ***


## IMPROVING AI
*** END OF YEAR PIPE IN MORE OF THESE FACTORS (INCLUDING CROSS DOMAIN) ****
if i don't, it becomes steered by default. (Evolution...)

[Reset] tech at 10. 


POLITICS - 0 IS IDEAL SCORE 

IDEOLOGY IF > 0 
DISPLAY POLITICAL




loop each country
def migration(balance,firepower,warFlag)



+10 .... DICTATORSHIP, LOSS OF FREEDOM, LOSS OF STAFF, LOSS OF ABILITY TO BUY STAFF
0 AIM FOR ZERO 
-10 .... LEADS TO WEALFARE, FAMIN, LOSS OF STAFF...




ENVIRONMENT - Until 1 person, invents nuclear (then make it easier)
Firest country gets advantage. 

Rule 
The first country to unlock tech level - gets lots of goodies (its expensive)
Env array, reduces the barrier to get to.
Less goodies. 
(FieldLeadership) = 10% ++ politicalLeadership (frontere within timeframe )

Incentive = people to try and be the first (academia & recruitment)
if you become a field leader: Staff++




[WEALFARE_STATE] - SCROUNGERS


level SHOULD RESET - MAKE LEVELS DEPENDENT ON THE ERA 

UPGRADE WEAPONS BASED UPON LEVEL 

ERA DETERMINS WEAPON STRENGHT 



1-10 = stone
11-20 = bronze...



RESEARCH POINTS

TO RESEARCH A ITEM/WEAPON/LEVEL

LV 1 = 1 RESEARCH POINTS

To level up, you need spend research points.

IN EACH ERA

WE HAVE TEN TECH LEVELS

CORRESPONDS TO 10 WAR ITEMS (REVOLVER....) 


STENGTH = WEAPON * ERA
